svn-blame  Show the SVN blame annotation for the current file, in a narrow
window to the left of it.

Usage:
  To get rid of it, close or delete the annotation buffer.

Bugs:
  If the source file buffer has unsaved changes, these aren't noticed and the
  annotations won't align properly. Should either warn or preferably annotate
  the actual buffer contents rather than the last saved version.

  When annotating the same source file again, it creates a new annotation
  buffer. It should re-use the existing one if it still exists.
